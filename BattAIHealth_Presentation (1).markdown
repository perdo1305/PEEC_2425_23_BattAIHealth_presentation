## Battery Basics: Introduction to Chemistries (2 min)  
- **What is a battery?**  
  - An electrochemical device that stores and releases energy through chemical reactions.  
- **Why batteries matter**: Power electric vehicles (EVs) and trains, critical for modern transportation.  
- **Battery Chemistries**:  
  - **Lithium-ion (Li-ion)**: High energy density, long life, used in EVs/trains.  
  - **Lead-acid**: Heavy, low energy, used in traditional vehicles.  
  - **Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH)**: Hybrid vehicles, less energy than Li-ion.  
  - **Solid-state**: Emerging, higher density, safer, still in development.  
- **Why Li-ion?** Ideal for transportation due to efficiency and reliability.
